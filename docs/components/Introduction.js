        ArrowJS is an experimental tool for programming reactive interfaces
        using native JavaScript. Itâ€™s not really a framework, but not less
        powerful than a framework either. At its core â€” ArrowJS is an admission
        that while we developers were falling in love with UI frameworks â€”
        JavaScript itself got good, really good.
      </p>
      <p>
        If JavaScript is so good, then what does a tool like Arrow bring to the
        table? So glad you asked. Arrow has 2 primary features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Observable data.</li>
        <li>Declarative/Reactive DOM rendering.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For many applications, these two features are all you need to build
        delightful and complex user interfaces. Need state management? Use a
        moduleâ€™s scope. Need components? Use functions. Need routing? The web
        platform already does this pretty well ðŸ˜‰.
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, Arrow boasts a few more important talking points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Zero dependencies.</li>
        <li>No build tools required (or even suggested).</li>
        <li>
          Less than <code>3KB</code> min+gzip. (22x smaller than this itty bitty gif â†’
          <img src="/img/mind-blown.gif" alt="gif of mind blown individual">)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Got time for a quick example? Great.</p>

      <h3>Commitment to JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        Arrow relies heavily on modern features of JavaScript such as
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals"
          >template literals</a
        >,
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules"
          >modules</a
        >
        (think <code>import</code> and <code>export</code>), and
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy"
          >Proxies</a
        >. For example, you'll immediately notice that Arrow does not have a
        special template "language" like so many other frameworks. Instead it
        relies on template literals (tick marks <code>\`</code>) â€” specifically
        tagged template literals â€” to interpolate expressions and render DOM
        elements. For example:
      </p>
      ${example(ListExampleCode, ListExample)}
      <p>
        Weâ€™ll go in depth on templates in a bit, but a key concept to understand
        here is that template literals, and tagged template literals, are
        <strong>native features of JavaScript</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why does this matter? Well for one it makes Arrow fast â€” most of the
        parsing is done using language-level features. More importantly,
        however, learning Arrow is mostly learning how to use modern native
        JavaScript to create UI systems, so the concepts here are portable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Already fancy yourself a great JavaScript developer? Great! Then learning
        Arrow won't take you any time at all.
      </p>
      <h3>Commitment to no build tools</h3>
      <p>
        Build tools can be useful. Arrow itself is written in TypeScript so it
        necessitates a build script to compile, but while there is no restriction
        against using a build tool, Arrow <em>will never require
        one</em>. Arrow removes the need for complex operations that are
        best left to compilers, like converting templates to render functions. It
        does this by making some assumptions:
        <ul>
          <li>It's ok to ship modern JS (no IE support)</li>
          <li>Youâ€™re writing HTML (not native voodoo)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        It will always be good and right to pull in Arrow from a CDN and start
        building your project right away.
      </p>
      <h3>Commitment to performance</h3>
      <p>
        Arrow is <em>fast.</em> Downloading, booting, and patching are all fast.
        In fact, you can generally expect on-par-or-better performance than
        its bigger JS framework counterparts. Arrow will always be a guilt-free
        choice for those under a performance budget.
      </p>
      <h3>Commitment to Open Source</h3>
      <p>
        Arrow was created by me, <a href="https://twitter.com/jpschroeder">Justin Schroeder</a>.
        It is Open Source. It will always be Open Source. My hope is this
        project helps reframe developerâ€™s expectations of "native" JavaScript.
